# collective.listjs - Plone integration for the List.js library

List.js is a lightweight JavaScript library that enhances HTL lists, by 
making them searchable, sortable, orderable, and filterable.

*collective.listjs* integrates List.js in Plone 4 by providing the library as a 
resource, together with a set of views that are usable out-of-the-box.


Installation
============

In your buildout.cfg, add the following:

    [instance]
    
    eggs =
        ...
        collective.listjs
        
    zcml =
        ...
        collective.listjs

Rerun the Buildout script to download and make available the egg as a new product.

Then, access your Plone instance and install it.


Usage
=====

A set of views for folderish content are made available once the product is installed.

To enable these views, go to the ZI/portal_types sections and add the following to
the available_views field of your chosen Folderish types (such as Folder and Topic):

 - listjs_folder_simple_view
 - listjs_folder_tabular_view
